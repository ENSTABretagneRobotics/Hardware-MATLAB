Hardware-MATLAB
==============
Windows : 
- In MATLAB, go to File\Set Path...\Add Folder... and add this folder as well as x86 folder if you use MATLAB 32 bit or x64 folder if you use MATLAB 64 bit.
- Run test_hokuyo.m to test.
- Check the other test_XXX.m files for usage information (only Hokuyo supported for now...).

Linux/Mac : 
- Follow the instructions in the Makefile.

Tested on Windows 8 64 bit using MATLAB R2014a.
